2025-09-09,9,10,Andrew McDougall,"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight from LHR to CDG was flawless. We were delayed however the Captain did address the whole plane and was apologetic. The Purser and cabin crew were excellent, friendly and helpful. I am very tall 1.97m and the seat was comfortable. I enjoyed the A220. Food was more than enough for a short flight. CDG was easy to navigate, however security can be a surly and daunting. The flight from CDG to Lima was very good and the seat which converted into a full flat bed was comfortable, however the bedding was not so great (1 deflated pillow and a thin canvass blanket of sorts, nothing else) and the food was excellent along with the entertainment. I asked for tonic water and was told its finished, I prefer to drink this rather than other fizzy drinks. A small let down. The male cabin crew were very aloof and not really engaging ( not unpleasant but uninterested with yes and no answers). The men were only interested in people who spoke French. I speak 6 languages but sadly not French. The female cabin crew were friendly helpful and made me feel welcome. I really enjoyed my flight ( day time flight of 12 hrs) and would gladly fly them again",Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Lima via Paris,September 2025,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5,Yes,Airbus A220-300 / Boeing 777-200
2025-09-03,1,10,David Rivero Lopez,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have been a Flying Blue member for years and previously held Gold status (2018–2021). Earlier this year, when I started a new job that requires frequent travel between Madrid and Nigeria, I made the conscious decision to prioritize flying almost exclusively with Air France/KLM in order to rebuild my Flying Blue status. Since March, I invested six months of loyalty and earned over 50 XP. Then, on September 1st, all of that progress was suddenly wiped out because Flying Blue resets XP annually on that date. The problem is not just the reset itself, but the lack of clear communication. Nowhere during my booking process or XP tracking was it made sufficiently clear that my efforts between March and September would simply vanish. If I had known, I would have never chosen Air France/KLM so consistently over other carriers. To me, this feels deceptive and unfair. It is essentially punishing loyal customers who joined or restarted mid-year, turning months of effort and money into nothing. I reached out to customer service, but the response was a generic explanation of the rules with no acknowledgment of the unfairness or any offer of a resolution. I still have two long-haul trips already booked and paid with Air France/KLM, but after that, I will reconsider my loyalty. There are plenty of airlines that value frequent flyers without playing tricks like this. In short: Lack of transparency about XP reset dates. Months of loyalty and over 50 XP wasted. Customer service offered no real solution. Trust in the Flying Blue program is gone. I share this experience so other frequent travelers are aware: if you are trying to rebuild status with Flying Blue, know that all XP resets every September 1st. Plan accordingly, or you risk wasting your time and money as I did.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Madrid to Lagos via Paris,August 2025,,,,,,,1,No,Boeing 777

An understandable situation, when one flight delayed, and another gets cancelled (last of the day) that should be normally and easily solved gets into a total havoc.

On my arrival at Pearson Airport in Toronto, I was informed that my flight had been cancelled. They booked me on another flight on July 5th. So, I will arrive in Stockholm on July 6th instead of 5th.  I had no choice but to agree to what Air France customer service offered. My return flight to Toronto was a nightmare from start to end. The boarding process was slow and started 15 minutes after the indicated time on the boarding pass. After sitting, I noticed the seat had tight legroom.

At CDG Airport, we were assured they would be returned within a few days. A week later, since nothing had arrived, we contacted the lost baggage service again. They told us our luggage had been sent to another country and would be returned soon. Another week passed, and after sending several registered letters, emails, phone calls, and official claims, we kept receiving the same promise: “your luggage will arrive any moment.” Imagine our shock when, three weeks later, we went back to Charles de Gaulle Airport and were told by staff that they had no idea what we were talking about or where our baggage was.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mexico to Paris,June 2025,2.0,4.0,1.0,,1.0,,2,No,

2025-06-19,1,10,Elyssa Techini,"Not Verified |    Air France has really gone downhill. You have to pay for everything: seat selection, even when you're flying with your family, carry-on luggage (which must be under 18 inches including wheels and handle), and your first checked bag. Customer service? Abysmal. You wait forever just to be told you need to pay more. The food is worse than what you'd find on the worst U.S. airline—which is saying something. And despite all this, it’s not a budget ticket. It’s expensive. The only thing still going for Air France is the name—France. And I love my country. But this airline is doing it no justice.

2025-06-19,4,10,R Warten,"✅ Trip Verified |   I had a not so nice trip with Air France from Edinburgh to Johannesburg. The flight from Edinburgh to Paris was okay, with only slight late departure. Once landed, I headed to the correct terminal according to the display screens to catch my connecting flight to Johannesburg. Then after an hour, they suddenly put a changed terminal on the display screens and I had to rush to get to another terminal and go through security for a second time. After I had for something to eat and did a bit of shopping, I went to sit by the seats next to the gate, only to find that the display screen screen was showing the flight as delayed, but with no other information and no customer service to assist. Then when checking their website, as their app did not have an update, it said the flight was cancelled. With no customer service staff around, I headed the the security section, where they said I had to go on a long walk to the main customer service desks far away. Then I was told that they had another flight that leaves the next morning, over 12 hours later than the original flight was supposed to take off. Got given a voucher for an overnight hotel stay, a €15 food voucher, directions to catch a shuttle to get to the hotel, a water bottle and a pack with a white tshirt and tooth brush. I was told that I could apply for compensation for the missed flight on the Air France website and also claim from them for costs associated with my missing a connecting flight in Johannesburg with airline and a hotel stay due to the late night arrival time of the replacement flight. €15 does not even buy an adult sized McDonald's meal at the airport. I laer found out that I was misinformed about them reimbursing my extra costs, which is bad customer service. I only managed to get 2.5 hours sleep at the hotel due to a very early shuttle bus to catch the early flight and loud noise from rain hitting the hotel's outside panelling. The replacement flight from Paris to Johannesburg was also about 30 minutes late to depart. The return flight from Johannesburg to Paris was 1 hour late to depart. The return flight from Paris to Edinburgh was 30 minutes late to depart. In terms of cabin experience, I was far from impressed. I found the economy class seats to be very narrow, my food was not very impressive in terms of quality, nor quantity either. Some alcohol was offered on the first flight  - champagne or red/white wine. No alcohol was offered to me on the return trip. I noticed that French speaking passengers got offered all drink types (champagne, red/white wine or beer) and various cognac bottles, which felt unfair. Very little water provided outside of the two supplied meals on the flights, in fact only a very small cup of water twice during the night on a 12 hour flight. No details of any other food and drink offerings were mentioned by the staff or on any in flight information. I could have done with a lot more food and drink on this long flight with very dry air inside the cabin. The food was mainly carbs as well. I got given a choice of chicken or pasta for the main meals. Very little chicken in the main dish and very little sauce too. This came with a bottle of water, juice, a small roll with butter and cheese, a portion of vegetables, a pack of French style bagels and a forgettable little desert that tasted of dry lemon cake. A meal fit for a child in my opinion",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Edinburgh to Johannesburg via Paris,June 2025,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,3,No,Boeing 777-300
2025-06-18,5,10,R Stack,"Not Verified | Returning from Paris, our flight was diverted from EWR to YUL due to weather in the New York area. The flight crew kept us informed and the cabin crew could not have been nicer. Unfortunately, the AF station in Montreal was overwhelmed by the unexpected influx of pax. They were not very skilled at managing the crowd. They had close to two hours before we arrived to get it together, and we were kept on the plane for almost two hours after we landed. A flight attendant near us looked at her watch and said, ""Uh oh, we time out at 7. They deplaned us at 6.55. After 2.5 hrs in line we got our food and hotel vouchers. We were assigned an Embassy Suites, and other pax got equally good hotels. The kicker was the next morning when we asked the hotel staff what we could do until our afternoon flight back to Newark.

2025-06-14,1,10,D Meng,"✅ Trip Verified |   Air France is probably the closest example of how bad an airline can get. I took 4 flights with them and 2 were late and the other 2 cancelled due to operation inadequacies. Even after the flight was cancelled, passengers were made to wait at a disembarkation room with no staff to provide information.

2025-06-08,1,10,Suyeon Hwang,"✅ Trip Verified |   Worst ground service I’ve experienced. At Vienna Airport, I asked the agent to check my luggage through to Incheon. They said “No problem,” but then tagged my bag to Paris CDG without informing me. Now I will be forced to collect and recheck my luggage at CDG, which defeats the purpose of choosing this itinerary. At the bag drop line I queued under a large Air France sign indicating the correct line. Without any announcement or guidance, staff suddenly 1turned off the sign — and when we reached the counter, they blamed us for being in the wrong line. I am not blind; everyone in that line was clearly following the Air France sign that was up when we queued.

2025-05-23,3,10,N Horton,"✅ Trip Verified |   Our return flight from Tahiti was delayed more than 24 hours due to an issue on Air France’s end. The delay required us to stay in Tahiti for an extra day, so we had to pay out of pocket for another hotel night, food, and transportation, which isn’t cheap. Air France reimbursed us for less than a third of the total cost, with no explanation, even though this clearly falls under the Montreal Convention. When we were told about the cancellation, we were told to go to the Air France desk at LAX to file a claim. But when we did, the person there just handed us a card with an 800 number and told us to call. No help, no effort, and totally different from what we were told earlier. We had also paid to upgrade our seats, but the Wi-Fi didn’t work at all on the return flight. It was just one more thing that added to how disorganized the whole experience felt.

2025-05-13,1,10,John Burgess-Webb,"Not Verified | We took 4 Air France flights in the space of 10 days. Buenos Aires to Paris CDG, delayed 3 and half hours. Once onboard, they announced there would be no coffee or tea because there was no hot water (for some reason). Upon arrival at CDG, there was little to no communication with respect to getting our hotel vouchers (as we had missed our connecting flight to London, and a night with my brother). We, my fourteen-year-old son and I; got to the airport hotel at 1130pm (we should have arrived at Heathrow at 9pm) and had to be on the new connecting flight to London at 7 am. So about 4 hours sleep. Once on the connecting flight, they announced that there was a problem with the electronics so we would be delayed as they tried to fix it. It didn't work. So they reset it or some such and we finally took off ater sitting onboard for roughly 2 hours. All for the 40-minute flight to London. Fastforward, on the return flight from Paris to Buenos Aires, we boarded on time, at about 12:40 pm for a 13:10 take-off time. We had not had lunch. We were informed at about 1 pm that the flight would be delayed as there was a mechanical issue and they were checking if we could fly anyway. Time passed. Now there was an announcement that they needed to get a spare part and install it before we could take off. It would be another hour. That was at 2:40 pm, already an hour an a half after scheduled takeoff. No water or snacks had been offered. I complained and got a few cereal bars for my son and me, handed to me surreptitiously by a kind attendant who whispered ""we don't have snacks for everyone"". We took off at 3:40, 3 hours after we had boarded the plane. We were given a tasty lunch about an hour later. Then, 11 hours later, we were given a hardbread mishmash breakfast. There was no dinner although the flight was from (theoretically) 1:10 pm until 2am the next day. 11 hours with no food service, during daytime hours.

2025-05-02,9,10,K Marden,"✅ Trip Verified |   Air France is picking up its game. I have to admit the latest A350 is great. The only downfall was boarding. They line you up and start boarding process, but leave you hanging in the hall, which was bright and sunny and extremely hot. The biz pax were waiting in the tube for about 20 minutes, the boarding process was a complete mess and no explanation was given by the staff at the boarding game. Fortunately that was the end of the bad news. The inside was nice. Seat clean and it has new shadow windows, seat back entertainment with USB A/C and smart holder for ipads / iphones on top of drink tray etc. Bluetooth headphone connectivity. Seat cushion is slightly hard, so my tail bone is sore, but I find that with most of the airlines nowdays. The plane looks good. Its bathroomns are a bit run down - and dirty - AF crew should be checking in more often, but otherwise I cannot find fault. Food was delicious even in economy. Staff was actually quite nice.

Although the flight was short (45 minutes in the air), the cabin crew served a (free) sandwich (Mediterranean vegetable flavour) and a choice of drink. This is more than their main competitor provides on this route. The crew was cheerful and friendly and carried out their duties efficiently. I was pleased to see they enforced their own safety rules- asking people to disconnect USB cables during take-off and landing (as it would be a trip hazard in an emergency). Despite taking off late from Heathrow (partly due to slow boarding as there was too much hand luggage in the cabin, and partly airport traffic congestion), we still arrived on time in Paris.

The in-flight food was atrocious, considering that the French brag about their cuisine the food was appalling. The service on the flight was terrible, the cabin crew tried their very hardest to ignore you as much as possible. I booked a premium economy ticket and the was expecting a comfortable flight. The reclining function was broken and the seat was extremely uncomfortable. I was offered a £50 voucher for the inconvenience.

Air France is now my definite top choice for Canada to Europe. Their business class way exceeds Air Canada, Turkish, and any other European carrier. I’ve done around 4 trips, almost all in business. Their food & wine quality is restaurant quality, very inventive & extremely good. On my Vancouver to Paris Feb 7th flight, Agnes was my main flight attendant. Her service was impeccable. Similarly my return flight Paris to Vancouver was also very good, flight attendants all excellent, focused & with very high levels of service. The A350 is a beautiful cabin. I got to sit in 1A coming back, and that felt like a first class seat, with extra room at bulk head pod & sliding door. I love how Air France sets up a little refreshment area during rest times. I’m Star Alliance generally, but for Europe, an Air France convert. Take note Lufthansa, you have a long way to catch up, and although I’ve had kind attendants and service on AC biz class, the food & wine quality does not compare to Air France, Merci beaucoup, Air France, and mademoiselle Agnes for her kindness on my flight over, and for the wonderful service I received. Their lounges are a bit crowded, but the quality is very good and again for food/drink, showers, rest areas.

2025-02-18,1,10,Andrew H Neal,"✅ Trip Verified | As a producer for Discovery Channel documentaries, where scheduling is as tight as budgets, I depend heavily on airlines to uphold their schedules. Unfortunately, my recent experience with Air France was nothing short of a disaster, showcasing a complete breakdown in both service and accountability. Our flight from LHR to CDG to SXM on January 10th started with arriving at LHR at the early hour of 3:15 AM for a 6:20 AM departure. The check-in process did not commence until 4:00 AM, and from then until 5:45 AM, absolutely nothing progressed. The Air France staff were visibly present but unhelpful, offering no explanations for the delay nor managing the growing line of anxious passengers. Despite multiple inquiries, the only information provided was about a computer malfunction. No alternative solutions were offered. Check-ins were eventually processed manually using cell phones, which was inefficient and caused significant delays. Our flight, as a result, left over five hours late. Due to the initial delay, we were forced to find and book an alternate flight to reach our destination, which was essential to keep our production on track. This not only added stress but also financial strain to our tightly budgeted project. On our return trip, Air France added insult to injury by charging us an additional 1,000 euros due to the missed original flight, blaming us for a problem they created. The return flight was no better, with a detour for refueling and another delay in Paris before finally arriving late in London. Throughout this ordeal, not once did any Air France representative offer a genuine apology or a practical solution, effectively stranding us without care. After these multiple failures, seeking compensation or even an acknowledgment of the inconvenience from Air France has been an uphill battle. The lack of empathy and assistance from their customer service is appalling, with representatives implying that the fault was ours for not tolerating their inefficiency. This experience has been a sobering reminder of how a company should not operate. Air France’s disregard for customer service and basic accountability has not only resulted in financial losses for our production but also an incredible waste of time and energy. I strongly advise against booking with Air France if your travel plans require reliability and professional service.",Business,Economy Class,London to St Martin via Paris,January 2025,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,No,?

Initially flight attendant's solution was to manually move it into the position I wanted for the flight and initially claimed no other seat was available. When I said I expected to either be moved or refunded in full my upgrade cost if the seat could not be fixed the two cabin crew looked indignant as if I had suggested something outrageous. In the end they fixed the seat and found another seat. Throughout the flight no attendants responded to the call button. This was needed a few times as they forgot various parts of the menu like the dessert. There were long wait times for anything. It was obvious AF don't crew the plane sufficiently. Most of the time I got out of my seat and walked to the galley if wanted something. I found the entire experience to be underwhelming and the crews couldn't careless attitude unacceptable.

2025-02-04,2,10,Marinelle van de Velde,"✅ Trip Verified | In December my husband and I flew to Mauritius: a 2 week holiday after a busy year (at 61 and 63). We were going to fly Business Class (for the first time) ; we were so excited to leave. This trip was going to be more than amazing... and it was - apart from the experience with Air France. The departure flight was disastrous due to the heavy turbulence. It was so bad all night long that we couldn't fold down, just bad luck due to the weather conditions. The service of the staff and crew on board was impeccable. Nothing to say. So far, all good! After 2 wonderful weeks on the spot we check in online for the return flight to Belgium (via Paris) and discover that we are not sitting next to each other. We call AF Brussels and an arrogant Dutch lady (merger KLM) tells us that we only had to pay 150 euros per person/one way to sit next to each other, on top of the Business price. Good to know! But that was just the beginning of the misery. On Christmas Day, December 25, the alarm goes off at 5 am to take us to the airport at 6:30 am for our flight home. Then my husband saw the email that AF had sent at 4 am. 1h30 delay on arrival in Paris, no more train connection to Brussels and the hotel we had booked in Brussels (145 euros) was unfortunately too late to cancel. We called AF Brussels, where a Dutch lady, even more arrogant than the previous lady, told us that we had to book a hotel on arrival in Paris and file a complaint. Good to know! The flight to Paris went very well and we arrived in Paris. After asking for explanations several times, we finally found the right place and joined a long line of passengers who were in the same situation as us. A lady offered us a night at the Ibis or the Melia, but before we got there, we had to: - Pick up our suitcases (15 minutes walk) - Crossing the entire airport with the suitcases to find the train to the hotel (20 minutes walk) - Searching for the hotel outside without lights for 20 minutes and this at almost midnight. The happiness of two weeks in paradise in Mauritius quickly disappeared. After a short night, we have to leave again at 5:30 in the morning to take the train to Brussels. On December 26, we finally arrived home at 2:00 p.m. (we left on December 25 at 6:30 a.m.), so it is not possible for us to go back to work on December 26 as planned! What an unforgettable Christmas! But it is not over yet: AF informs us that the delay does not entitle us to compensation/damages due to the bad weather conditions, where there was not a single cloud and the sky was oh so clear. They lie and deny all responsibility… as if it were our fault! We travel often, but in all the years we travel economy class, we have never experienced such an unfair situation: no respect for travelers and a dishonest airline. Conclusion: Mauritius is a dream, but AIR France is a nightmare!

Call-bells answered promptly despite full plane. AF should serve a hot meal or offer hot snacks for all international flights. Elaborate cockpit announcements were very informative. Can’t fault AF much; they are on the rise and do their best. Economy Light ticket was very cheap disallowing checked in luggage.

This is what we mentioned to the support staff at the Air France Desk. The staff member there was not surprised, not helpful and simply plain rude. He printed out new boarding tickets for a flight 6.5 hours later(!) We did not get an apology - only a 15 EUR voucher; which at Paris-Charles de Gaulle is barely enough for a hot meal with a drink.

We were informed a couple days before our departing flight that our flight was delayed by a day. As people who have traveled extensively, we understand that this is not uncommon, but the way Air France handled the rescheduling of our flight was tumultuous to say the least. In order to get our returning flight pushed back a day (so we would not lose an entire day from our trip) we had to contact multiple people online and over the phone, wasting hours with unhelpful customer service. But we eventually managed to move our returning flight and confirm our departing flight. Being concerned about how that situation was handled, I called Air France to make sure our flight was confirm two days before our departing flight. We were assured multiple times that our flight and seats were confirmed. However, when we arrived at the Detroit airport, I was told by someone who worked for Air France that my flight was not only unconfirmed, but that she had noticed my ticked was unconfirmed 24 hours ago and was “wondering and waiting for me to confirm” my flight. When I asked why I never received a call or email to confirm my flight since she was curious about my flight status herself, the agent just shrugged her shoulders and laughed. The agent began to show animosity toward me at this moment because she must’ve taken my question as an insult (despite it being a valid question). The agent continuously said that because my flight was unconfirmed, they likely gave the seat to someone else and it would now be impossible for me to get on that flight. She said she would look to check the flight but gave the impression there was nothing she could do now.

I pointed out I was flying for the sole purpose of kitesurfing and without the requisite equipment the holiday was ruined and the flight pointless.  The flight from LHR to CDG was fine. We were given a nice sandwich. The problem started on the CDG > GRU leg an 11 hour overnighter on a 777. The plane was shabby and old. There was no pre dinner drinks service with the drink served at the same time as the main meal - not what you want on an 11 hour flight departing in the evening. They had run out of Premium Economy food so I got Economy food and mine was disgusting - miserable and tasteless. My travelling companion got the Premium Economy meal which was almost as bad (there is it seems virtually no difference). The worst bit by far is the seat which does not recline and is as hard as a rock. Indeed the seat on the A220 for the 40 minute flight from London in economy was better than this seat. Truly terrible. On the return leg it was virtually impossible to check in to Gol (their Brasilian in country partner) as the Air France ticket locator code is not recognised on the Gol website. On GRU to CDG flight we at least got a drinks service. But the food was just as bad as before. I was offered a drink after the meal that was served in a cardboard cup. The seat was still like lying on a rock. Again no sleep possible on an overnight flight. Security going to the K gates was a lengthy and stressful mess. I realise this is not Air France's fault; but it is part of the Air France experience since that is where you have to change planes, so is relevant if you are thinking of booking. Overall the extra charged for their ""premium economy"" is simply not worth it. Things they need to do to fix it: 1. Live up to their promise and actually take your sports equipment instead of prioritising cargo. 2. Update their planes (the 777 was ancient) 3. Provide a proper drinks service 4. Upgrade the food 5. Upgrade the seats so they are comfortable and recline a bit, so you can sleep. 6. Make sure AF locator codes work on partner airlines for checkin 7. Get CDG airport to speed up the security process for transfers.",Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Sao Paulo to Paris,October 2024,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2,No,Boeing 777
2024-10-07,8,10,M Laurent,"✅ Trip Verified | I very much enjoyed this trip in premium economy. The seats are wider compared to economy with just 8 seats per row instead of 10. Everyone gets their own armrests on both sides. The seat recline is generous and the seat is built in a way that allows for a couple of hours of sleep. The premium economy cabin is separated by a wall and curtains from the economy cabin. This allows for a cosy feeling in a small cabin of just six seat rows. The entertainment screen and system are up to date. The headphones provided are fixed to the seat. Alternatively, you could pair your own headphones through Bluetooth, which worked flawlessly. The food quantity and quality on the other hand falls short. On the 13 hour flight to Paris, only one meal was served just after take off. The crew occasionally distributes snacks and tiny sandwiches. There's another hot snack before landing. Better to stock up on snacks and a bottle of water in the convenience store after security at the airport. The premium economy tickets gives access to Sky Priority benefits in the airport and allows you to board in group 2, ahead of most passengers in economy class. At Seoul Incheon Airport, there were sadly no provisions for Sky Priority lanes for security and passport control.

2024-09-14,2,10,C Deane,"✅ Trip Verified |   I recently flew from Zanzibar to Paris in July 2024, and it was by far the worst international flight experience I’ve ever had. I was forced to sit next to a passenger who continuously vomited into a bag and coughed on me throughout the flight. I requested several times to have my seat moved but was told the plane was full. After takeoff, I noticed multiple empty seats, and some passengers were able to stretch out and sleep comfortably. I, however, was still forced to stay in my seat next to the sick passenger. When I asked the flight attendant again after takeoff about changing my seat, she spoke in French to another attendant and a passenger near the bathroom, completely ignoring me. To make matters worse, the sick passenger's mother got up to dispose of the vomit bags, confirming she was seated next to me. They never came to sanitize the area or move me, leaving me in an unsanitary and uncomfortable situation for the entire 8.5-hour flight. As an educator traveling internationally for both business and leisure, I didn’t want to cause a scene, especially being a Black traveler in a situation where we often face unfair treatment. It’s disheartening to feel like I had no option but to endure this, knowing how things could escalate unjustly. After the flight, I emailed Air France, and after weeks of waiting, they responded with an insulting $100 voucher that wasn’t even valid, and they never followed up with a call or proper discussion. I do not recommend flying with Air France. It’s disappointing to see Delta partnered with them, leaving me with little choice when traveling internationally.

Let’s start with the appalling mistreatment I endured at Paris CDG Airport, particularly in Terminal M and at Counter 9. The airport staff at Paris CDG Airport, particularly in Terminal M and at Counter 9  seemed to have forgotten the basics of customer service. Rude, dismissive, and completely unhelpful, they managed to turn a stressful situation into a nightmare. When my connecting flight from Prague to Paris was delayed and caused me to miss my connection to Santiago (SCL), the staff’s reaction was an utter disgrace. The only solution they offered was a rebooking option two days later. There was no accommodation provided, no food vouchers, just a bottle of water and a meal box that could only be described as a sad, inedible joke. The airline’s blatant lack of ownership and accountability was evident throughout. My ordeal was further exacerbated by the deplorable conditions of the airport.  To add to the misery, Air France’s confusing hand baggage and personal item policy feels like a cynical ploy designed to force customers to check their hand luggage for an exorbitant fee. The courteous staff explained before the security check that your perfectly reasonable hand luggage was too heavy to be considered a personal item. They then inform you that checking it in will incur a steep fee.   One would think that Air France would care to make up for their mistakes, but the only response that support offered after this whole ordeal was ""I hope that you can accept our position and that we might have an early opportunity to restore your confidence in our service.""",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Buenos Aires,July 2024,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,No,Boeing 787-9

Air France check-in staff was having an awful and not professional attitude towards me and others clients, when I approached gently his counter. First thing I was asked aggressively before even been greeted, was about to take out of me my unique small hand bag, fully compliant with AF/KLM cabin baggage standards. I am a frequent traveler, used to travel a lot (formerly Gold Flying Blue member), and I was chocked the way I’ve been addressed this early morning. I so try to explain the reason why I took this small hand bag for 1 day trip as I as had to work straight upon arrival. The staff didn’t even listen and kept repeating his off rule not mentioned anywhere, saying that passengers seated on zone 5 of the aircraft, they have to check-in hand bags without discussion, while others clients from other counters, were allowed to keep it even extra cases, despite the fact they were also traveling in Economy class. I wasn’t even seated in an emergency exit. I explained again and he told me arrogantly that I didn’t understand what he was saying to me. He also shown me that it was written in the boarding pass “hand bag not guaranteed” which obviously doesn’t mean they are forced to remove all hand bags of compliant customers as I was. I wish I could have spoken on this early morning day to a gentle and smiling person who could have been able to explain to me the situation instead of imposing his own rule, which not stated anywhere. I was told at gate that he was the most nicely person of AF ground services team at TLS airport. Perhaps very lovely person with his friends and colleagues, but not definitely with AF/KL clients. This unusual situation to me made me a very bad day regrettably. There is a way to greet and approach clients and made them do what you want them to do without creating a bad feeling, resulting an a regrettable customer experience, thus a disappointing image of the airline.

For whatever it is worth, I hope this helps someone else if on the fence with booking - I don't like to complain but somehow I needed to do what I could to hold this airline accountable for my experience. They did nothing to resolve it and I'm still left with anger and frustration to being silenced and without resolution.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Paris,January 2024,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,No,
2024-07-10,1,10,E Kan,✅ Trip Verified |  They delay the first flight and the second flight leaves early so many people couldn’t make the second flight. I got business class but they downgrade me and ask that I file refund separately by “contacting” the airline. I cannot get a hold of anyone in the airline by phone. I file a refund claim which I’m reading Air France doesn’t seem to respond to. I will be asking my bank for chargeback since Air France seems to be incompetent. This isn’t the first time a delay has occurred but it was the worst incident which is why I’m writing the review. Not to mention with my business class my luggage weight would be fine but it’s too heavy for economy which they downgraded me to so I had to pay an extra 115 euros. (CDG forces everyone to weigh their bags) so do I think this airline and airport is one big scam?,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hamburg to Singapore via Paris,July 2024,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,No,

2024-07-07,3,10,R Cardom,"✅ Trip Verified |  My family of 4 and I are long-time, loyal Delta customers and often times our flights are operated by Air France. Recently, during a multi-stop trip, we experienced 3 separate terrible experiences, leaving us unwilling to fly Air France again. First, from LAX to CDG, our flight was expected to be delayed which would result in our missed connection out of CDG. We were informed the morning of, and we were automatically, without our input/consent, changed to another flight later in the day. It took a 2 hour long phone call to convince the Air France representative that our preference was to remain on our original flight (despite the missed connection), and that they should not have assumed our preference was to take the later flight (which would not have made it to CDG in time for our connection anyway). The Air France representative insisted that I was the one who had requested the change during an earlier phone call, which was a blatant lie. Next, from BCN to CDG, our flight was canceled due to smoke detected in the rear of the plane. While we truly appreciate the safety precaution, this led us to be delayed, potentially missing our connection flight home from CDG. We were shuttled out of the plane, and taken back to the terminal where we were greeted and instructed by absolutely no one, displaying a shocking lack of empathy and support. We were all on our own, left to figure out how we would retrieve our bags, rebook flights, where to go, etc. Air France customer service dropped the ball here yet again. Finally, on our rebooked flight from BCN to CDG, our flight was 2 hours delayed due to an employee strike. The Air France employee speaking on the intercom was very clear to let us know that it was not Air France's fault, but rather the fault of a contractor. While this may be true, I still hold Air France accountable, and they could have handled the situation better by communication updates more frequently, and being better prepared by foreseeing the strike or having a contingency plan to minimize delays. Ultimately, we missed our connection flight out of CDG and had to stay in a mediocre hotel by the airport until our flight the next day.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Barcelona via Paris,July 2024,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1,No,

2024-07-06,1,10,H Shaw,"✅ Trip Verified | Whatever you do, do not travel if you have a disability. Air France will not help and does not care. They changed my gate information after issuing me the boarding pass. The new gate was 5 miles away from the original. Not just a few gates. Because they refused to give me my boarding pass once I was in their wheelchair assist program, I could not move on my own. On top of that, their staff kept us away from any monitors that would have shown the gate had changed. At NO POINT did they ever email, text or call us to let us know the new gate. Because their wheelchair assist was so slow, we showed up at the wrong gate with only 15 minutes left only to see an empty gate. They refused to hold the flight, even though it left 30 minutes late. So they weren't pressed for time, they just don't give a darn Out of the 12+ employees we dealt with, ONE helped. The rest were useless and lazy. They do not care about people at all. We were able to get a flight on Delta and make it home. One piece of luggage was delayed, but again, the luggage was being held by Air France and they don't care. Once it fell into the hands of Delta, it moved very quickly. On the flight getting to Europe, they gave us 4 ounces of water and that was all for a 10 hour flight. Then lost one piece of our luggage and lied to us about it. I have heard that the French are rude to Americans, but I assumed it was more urban myth; NOPE. Air France is cheap, poor service and will not help no matter the situation. Heaven help those traveling to Paris for the Olympics.

2024-06-25,8,10,T Mudiayi,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was a passenger on “Air France” flight AF0995 on June 21, 2024 leaving Johannesburg for Paris, CDG, in seat 31A when, an hour and a half after takeoff, I experienced sudden and serious illness: headache, choking, profuse sweating, nausea, generalized body weakness and gradual loss of consciousness. My wife, Tshabu Mudiayi, who occupied seat 31B noticed my distress and asked me what was wrong. I tell him to turn on the fresh air. The plane -Boeing! – did not have this button or the staff call button. She had to leave me in a panic to go and inform the hostesses of my situation. I was slowly losing consciousness. The staff, a woman and a man, arrived quickly and immediately began a very basic, but nonetheless effective, “resuscitation”. I myself have been an internist for 46 years and I could, although inert, hear: “lift your legs, is the pulse present?, place the ice cubes on the neck, bring more, remove the anourak, pat his head, try to talk to him…let's move him to the front of the empty row, he's heavy, the big baby (!) – I'm 72 years old! -, can you hear us, sir? There are also two doctors among the passengers, we’ll take care of you, you’ll be fine…” After about fifteen minutes of effort, I completely came to my senses. I felt good and out of danger. Even the Commander came to see what was happening.  Your agents came back again in the morning to reassure me about my condition. I was able to eat. My journey continued without problem to CDG, Paris, and then Toronto, my final destination from where I am writing to you. I would like here to express my appreciation for the “professionalism”, the rapid and efficient assistance of the personnel of this flight and also for the attention and delicacy that the commander, a Mr. Petro - I was told - demonstrated on the client and the patient that I was.  J’etais passager sur le vol AF0995 d’“Air France” le 21 juin 2024 quittant Johannesburg  pour Paris, CDG, sur le siege 31A lorsque, une heure et demie apres le decollage, je fus pris d’un malaise soudain et serieux: maux de tete, suffocation, sueurs abondantes, nausees, faiblesse corporelle generalisee et survenue progressive d’une perte de connaissance. Mon epouse, Tshabu Mudiayi, qui occupait le siege 31B s’apercut de ma detresse et me demanda ce qui n’allait pas. Je lui dis d’activer l’air frais. L’avion -Boeing! – n’avait pas ce bouton ni celui d’appel du personnel. Elle dut me quitter en panique pour aller informer les hotesses de ma situation. Je perdais doucement connaissance. Le personnel, une femme et un homme, arriva rapidement et entreprit immediatement une “reanimation” tres basique, mais efficace cependant. Je suis moi-meme medecin-interniste depuis 46 ans et je pouvais, quoiqu’ inerte, entendre: “souleve les jambes, le pouls est-il present?, pose les glacons sur le cou, apporte-z-en encore, enleve son anourak, tapote la tete, essaye de lui parler…deplacons-le devant a la rangee vide, il est lourd, le gros bebe (!) – j’ai 72 ans! -, vous nous entendez, Monsieur? Il y a aussi deux medecins parmi les passagers, on s’occupe de vous, ca ira…” Au bout d’une quinzaine de minutes d’efforts, je repris totalement mes esprits. Je me sentais bien et hors de danger. Meme le Commandant vint voir ce qui se passait.  Vos agents revinrent encore le matin me /se rassurrer sur mon etat. J’ai pu manger. Mon voyage continua sans probleme jusque CDG, Paris, et ensuite Toronto, ma destination finale d’ou je vous ecris. Je voudrais ici exprimer mon appreciation pour le “professionalisme”, le secours rapide et efficace du personnel de ce vol et aussi de l’attention et la delicatesse que le commandant, un Monsieur Petro -m’a-t-on dit- ont demontre sur le client et le malade que j’etais.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg to Paris,June 2024,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3,Yes,

Almost 4 months later I haven't received any compensation, and the company stopped following up with me.

2024-06-16,4,10,R Wagner,"✅ Trip Verified | My trip was a code-share ticket through Delta (miles) in Business Class from Houston to Paris. This review is for the Air France flight from Mexico City to Paris (CDG). First, the lounge experience that Air France leverages in Mexico City is subpar. The hard product (A350-900) is a very nice aircraft. No complaints with the seat, although the space for legs/feet for sleeping is a bit tight. Boarding was hectic in Mexico City. The flight attendants were friendly but nothing beyond the basics. The food was poor. The steak dish was horrible and bland (and cool). What really made this flight the worst, was the fact that Air France did not load any passenger bags (or pets) on this flight and did not tell the passengers until after arrival in Paris (at an empty baggage claim belt), and everyone had to enter a claim. Even though they knew this for the entire eleven hour flight. Apparently overloaded with cargo. Air France does not have bag tracking like United (for example) and the claim system was not updated promptly, so no indication of if/when bag would be delivered until a few hours before arrival at hotel the following evening (and I was leaving for another city in the morning!). Submitting claims for items purchased in slow and they don't except bank credit card receipt info (even though this shows date/location/store/item type, etc.). Had to be persistent with my responses and still not be compensated for the entire amount. Ability to contact Air France Customer Service is not easy to do. They have it set up to mostly avoid ""human"" contact.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,Mexico City to Paris,May 2024,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,,2,No,A350-900

2024-06-08,1,10,Nicholas Pipikios,"Not Verified |   Months ago we purchased two nonstop tickets from Chicago to Paris. The night before our flight, we got an email that we've been rebooked Chicago - Detroit - Paris, with the first leg being on Delta, the second leg being Air France in Detroit. We were annoyed because we paid for a nonstop ticket, but figured, at least we will still get in Paris, just a few hours after our original itinerary. Well, Delta to Detroit was delayed, and even with 20 of us that got rebooked on that Delta flight in Chicago trying to make the Paris connection, Air France did not wait for us in Detroit. We landed 36 minutes after the scheduled Paris departure. Now, we were stuck for a whole day in Detroit. We had horrible room accommodations, a shuttle that never showed up, and a day wasted on our short itinerary. To make matters worse, there was no one at Detroit airport from Air France (AF) to talk to all day so we tried working through an agent with Delta, but they could not see AF's international flights to help. Since we were now arriving in Paris a whole day later, we had a hotel night we had to pay for, museum tickets purchased in advance we could not use, and dinner reservations with a strict cancellation policy that charged us for not showing, despite our emails and pleas to not charge. Regardless, AF initial decision to bump 20 of us off the original nonstop flight in Chicago to Paris, caused us all to miss a whole day in Paris and cost us hundreds of dollars. I made a claim on Air France's website, which they replied to and said because the delay was less than 3 hours, no compensation would be rewarded. What are they even talking about? They clearly did not read our claim, so I called customer service, to which they could only reopen the claim but we cannot talk to anyone on the phone who handles the claims. I pleaded with them on two separate phone calls over two days to please let me talk to someone in claims or customer service or anyone who can help, to which they were very strict in saying there is no one for me to call, I just need to wait another week to hear back by email. Sure, the email's that they don't read and just send random responses to... all I can think of now is to get their attention by 1 star reviews.  What a horrible airline, with horrible policies.

2024-05-29,2,10,Sean Harvey,"Not Verified |   I booked a San Francisco to Paris flight - with extra legroom. Two days before my flight, I received an email from Air France telling me that I could upgrade to business class for an additional $1,100 (no small amount, but a fraction of the normal business class ticket price). Ticket purchased and confirmed. The next day, I received an email saying that they have switched aircraft and that my business class ticket would no longer be honored. I applied for a refund on Air France's non-user-friendly site, only to be told eight times that I didn't qualify, but twice that I did, only to later receive another notice saying I had filled the form out incorrectly. They just send back a decline and no further instructions. This has been going on since January. I've spent hours navigating their system. Long ago had to pay the credit card bill. This run around seems intentional. (I've even had French friends get involved and each time they hit a wall - not because I'm not entitled to a refund, which I clearly am, but because the online system either disconnects or ends up requesting information that I couldn't possibly have.) Even when they told he that my paid for seat was not available, the second line in the email said, ""You will receive a full refund for the price of your ticket."" It's not rocket science.
