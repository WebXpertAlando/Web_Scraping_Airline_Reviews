## Introduction
An airline review is a written or recorded evaluation shared by passengers about their experience with an airline. These reviews usually cover different aspects of the journey, such as:

- Booking & Check-in – ease of ticket purchase, online check-in, boarding process.
- Comfort & Seating – legroom, seat design, cleanliness, overall comfort.
- Cabin Crew Service – professionalism, friendliness, and responsiveness of staff.
- Food & Beverages – quality, variety, and availability of meals/snacks.
- In-flight Entertainment & Amenities – movies, Wi-Fi, magazines, or other features.
- Punctuality & Reliability – on-time departures and arrivals, handling of delays.
- Baggage Handling – efficiency, safety, and accuracy of luggage management.
- Value for Money – whether the experience matched the price paid.

Airline reviews can be posted on travel websites, apps, forums, or social media, and they help future travelers make informed decisions. Airlines themselves also use reviews to improve service quality and customer satisfaction.
